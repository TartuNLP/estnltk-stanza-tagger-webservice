2) Models `/et/depparse`, `/et/depparse/ensemble_models` and `/et/pretrain` are not included in this repository, but they can be downloaded from:  [https://entu.keeleressursid.ee/public-document/entity-9791](https://entu.keeleressursid.ee/public-document/entity-9791) **TODO: this is an old download location, which has outdated models and misses the ensemble models**
